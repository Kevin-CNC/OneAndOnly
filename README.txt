Made by Kevin Caplescu as a school-related project in 2023.

The main aim of this project was to create a simple, enclosed chatting system within a network using only Python for the backend & frontend.
Libraries used: Socket, Tkinter, FireBase, SQLite.

The project featured 2 types of databases:
* FireBase real-time database for user information storage.
* SQLite database for more user-personal details.

This was also adapted for usage from users all around the world, however due to a lack of resources such feature was never fully implemented nor tested.

KEEP IN MIND:
This project won't work fully even without using any global functionality, as all the FireBase credential files (which were essential for database connection & startup of the application itself) were deleted.
If you wish to test the application, please create your own FireBase database & replace any needed key/add any needed credential.
